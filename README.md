# :closed_book: HoraDoFuxico
A project made with React Native + Zustand

## :question: About the project

Developed during the course of Software Entrepreneurship, this application seeks to solve the problem of lack of 
entertainment for the elderly. The idea is to provide a space controlled by moderators where seniors can meet and 
interact with people of the same age group, where they can schedule time to talk about the most diverse topics.
